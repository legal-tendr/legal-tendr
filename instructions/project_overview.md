# Project Overview: LegalTendr

## 1. Core Concept

**LegalTendr** is a mobile-first web application designed to connect clients with lawyers through an intuitive, "Tinder-style" matching interface. This prototype focuses exclusively on the **client-side experience**.

## 2. Top Priorities

1.  **Mobile-First UI/UX:** The prototype must look and feel like a native mobile app running on a phone. The layout should be contained within a centered, phone-sized frame.
2.  **Fluid Swiping Interface:** The core "Discover" feature, where clients swipe on lawyer profiles, must be smooth, visually appealing, and intuitive.

## 3. User Journey

The primary user flow for this prototype is:

**Sign In Page** -> **Main Application (Dashboard)**

## 4. Key Features to Prototype

* **Sign In:** A simple login page with one hardcoded user credential.
* **Dashboard:** A home screen showing summary information (recent cases, messages).
* **Discover:** The Tinder-style swiping interface for liking/passing on lawyer profiles.
* **My Cases:** A page to view and manage legal cases.
* **Messages:** A list of conversations with lawyers.
* **Account:** A standard user account/settings page.
* **Navigation:** A persistent, floating, rounded dock at the bottom of the screen for navigating between the main pages.
